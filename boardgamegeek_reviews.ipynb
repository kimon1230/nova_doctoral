    "These are the steps:\n",
    "1. Download [the latest zip file](https://boardgamegeek.com/data_dumps/bg_ranks) containing the CSV with all games and summary rating data.\n",
    "    - This is a manual step and requires the user to be logged into the website\n",
    "    - After downloading the ZIP, extract the included CSV into the same directory as this notebook\n",
    "2. Filter list to those with at least 1000 votes and sort by vote count in descending order\n",
    "3. For each game, use the XML API to retrieve the comments\n",
    "    - Paginate through each result set as needed\n",
    "    - Remove unnecessary tags\n",
    "    - Ignore blank or non-english comments\n",
